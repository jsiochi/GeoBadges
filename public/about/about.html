        Thereâ€™s never been such a good time to learn about our changing world. But our systems for promoting geographic competence have not kept pace. Too often students are confined to old fashioned tests and paper maps in traditional classrooms, and are not rewarded for all the learning they do out in the real world. The GeoBadges initiative provides a new open learning ecosystem focused on helping teachers explore mapping tools and lessons that they can incorporate into their classroom.

        <br/> GeoBadges is just getting started, so if you have ideas or would like to get involved, please contact us now!
        <br/>
        <br/> GeoBadges is convened by the American Geographical Society - the oldest geography organization in the United States, and the third oldest in the world. Partners from the open mapping community, including the MapStory Foundation, GeoMakers, TeachOSM, and more are playing a key role in developing the GeoBadges ecosystem. It was launched with original support from the Longview Foundation.
