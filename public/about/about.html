        There's never been such a good time to learn about our changing world. But our systems for promoting geographic competence have not kept pace. Too often students are confined to old fashioned tests, paper maps, or if they are lucky, mapping applications they can only access on computers at school. The GeoBadges initiative provides a new open learning ecosystem focused on rewarding skill building and acts of service that students - of all ages - do in the geography domain. <br> <br>
We work with government agencies, companies, educational institutions and nonprofit groups who design and submit GeoBadges for review by our Peer Review Committee. Once accepted, they are opened for anyone to work on and earn. Points of Contact at the host organization of the GeoBadges are responsible for issuing them to requesting learners. <br> <br>

If you're an individual with a great idea for a GeoBadge you want to manage yourself, or have another organization adopt, you're also welcome to submit your idea for consideration by the Peer Review Committee. <br> <br>

<i>GeoBadges complies with the COPPA and DCMA laws of the United States. Only individuals age 13+ are eligible to earn GeoBadges.
