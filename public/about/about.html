        Thereâ€™s never been such a good time to learn about our changing world. But our systems for promoting geographic competence have not kept pace. Too often students are confined to old fashioned tests, paper maps, or if they are lucky, mapping applications they can only access on computers at school. The GeoBadges initiative provides a new open learning ecosystem focused on helping teachers explore mapping tools and lessons that they can incorporate into their classroom - or beyond the classroom walls. <br> <br>


Any educator or professional working in the geography field, broadly defined, is welcome to apply for status to create GeoBadges for learners to work on. Applications will be reviewed by a Peer Review Committee. If approved, applicants will receive log-in credentials to create their GeoBadge, enabling learners to then begin learning and earning. GeoBadges can target any age group, starting from Grade 3-5 and extending to professional certification. GeoBadges also use a wide variety of technical tools, especially those that are open source and affordable. And, GeoBadges should try to align themselves to the content expectations and curriculum frameworks teachers are responsible for. <br> <br>

GeoBadges is convened by the American Geographical Society - the oldest geography organization in the United States, and the third oldest in the world. Partners from the open mapping community, including the MapStory Foundation, GeoMakers, TeachOSM, and more are playing a key role in developing the GeoBadges ecosystem. It was launched with original support from the Longview Foundation. <br> <br>
