        Are you an educator or professional working in a geography oriented field? Do you have an idea for a project that students could work on to build geographical competence or even make a real world impact? If so, let us know about your idea by filling out the form below! If we see a fit, we'll send you the log-in credentials you need to start creating your own GeoBadge. Once submitted, your GeoBadge will be reviewed by a <a ui-sref="about">team of reviewers</a> and and either be added to the GeoBadges commons, or returned to you with suggestions for improvement.
